# SAFA Con 2024

These are the slides for my talk at SAFACon, `Laundering C2 traffic through high reputation services`. During the presentation I gave an overview of current infrastructure and transport tradecraft and then showed how it is possible to tunnel C2 traffic over high-reputation cloud, domain and endpoint services.
